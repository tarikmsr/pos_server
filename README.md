A Point of Sale (POS) app for waiters developed in Flutter, efficient, and user-friendly solution tailored for restaurant staff to manage orders and streamline operations. Here's a detailed description:

# Key Features

 **1- Order Management:**

   - Allows waiters to take orders directly on their mobile devices or tablets.
   - Supports modifying or updating orders in real time.
   
**2- Menu Integration:**

  - Provides a digital menu with categories, dish descriptions, and images.
  - Highlights special offers and recommended items.

**3- Cart (Panier) System:**

   - Lets waiters add multiple menu items to a cart for each table or chair.
   - Items in the cart include details like quantity, price, and special instructions.
   - Supports editing (e.g., modifying quantity, removing items) and viewing total price.
   - Allows submitting finalized orders to the kitchen or saving them for later modification.

**4- Order Tracking:**

  - Tracks order status (e.g., preparing, ready for serving).
  - Real-time updates from the kitchen or barman.


**5- Payment Handling:**
   
   - Supports multiple payment methods (cash, card).

**6- Daily Statistics:**
   
   - Waiters can view daily statistics, such as the number of orders served, total sales, and tips collected.
   - Provides an overview to track individual performance.

**7- Super Admin Controls:**
   - Super Admins can customize the appâ€™s functionality to fit restaurant policies.
      Options include:
      - Hide Images: Disables image display in the menu for a simplified interface.
      - Deny Cancel Order: Restricts waiters from canceling orders once submitted.
      - Hide Statistics: Prevents certain roles (e.g., waiters) from accessing daily statistics.

**8- Offline Functionality:**
  
  - Ensures basic operations (e.g., taking orders) can be performed without an internet connection.
  - Syncs data automatically when back online.

**9- Multi-language Support:**
